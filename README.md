# disaster control

Planning:
Our plan is to build a program for a network of IoT in a region which is specifically prone to man-made disaster, or where a disaster is likely to occur as a result of another natural disaster or lead to a chain of disasters

Working Principle:
The network comes is installed with a GPS which is used to detect the place of disaster from an external input or comes with devices as a part of IoT which could detect disasters, for example, MEMS acceleerometer which detect earthquakes or landslides or a heat sensor which detect fire outbreak, etc. The input from these devices or sources is taken and upon considering the working conditions of the equipments and the intensity of the disaster, the program decides to cut off/turn of the equipment. For example, an intense earthquake could break a natural gas pipe and make the gases escape into atmosphere causing problems to living things in that region. With the help of such a network, the gas supply from the pipe is cutoff as soon as it detects the activity of the earth quake.

Usage:
Users can directly install it like any other IoT connectivity which is quite easy. They need to have a system which is there to monitor the activity of the devices.

Technologies:
IoTivity, GPS and programming on java platform.

Datasets:
Input from the end nodes will be taken.
